Simple implementation of an app controlling the TP-Link HS110 Smartplug. Ability to use it without connecting
it to the Internet (without cloud) and to shut it down when the power consumption goes lower than a given threshold. 
This helps e.g. to load an e-bike battery only to 90%. Based on this search: https://www.softscheck.com/en/reverse-engineering-tp-link-hs110/
